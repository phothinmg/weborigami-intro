# Weborigami-intro

This repository is the starting point for the [Origami language tutorial](https://weborigami.org/language/tutorial.html). You can follow the tutorial to develop this starting point into a simple website.

## Running this tutorial locally

The tutorial is written with the assumption you're going to use GitHub Codespaces.

If you're okay with that, follow the tutorial instructions, but if you'd prefer to run the project on your local machine then:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`. This will start a local Origami server.

If you'd like to understand how the project's `dev` and `build` commands, see the documentation for these [standard Origami incantations](https://weborigami.org/cli/incantations.html).
